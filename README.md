Thank you for stopping by!

This is a basic "Harry Potter Sorting Hat" app made with React.js
Feel free to download it and modify it to your liking :D

Make sure you have node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/

Once you download it, install it using: npm install
Then use: npm start

My own final version: https://anothersortinghat.netlify.app/
